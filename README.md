Summary of Analysis:
Data Exploration: Examined dataset structure using .info() and .describe(); checked categorical distributions with .value_counts().
Visualizations:
Used histograms and boxplots to study distributions and detect outliers.
Used scatterplots and pairplots to explore relationships between numerical features.
Applied heatmap to identify correlations among variables.
Observations: Identified trends, relationships, and key patterns in the data from the visualizations.
Insights: Combined observations suggest which features are strongly related, patterns in data distribution, and potential areas for deeper analysis or modeling.
